/**
 * A spatial index for data items that can each be represented as geographic WGS84 latitude-longitude points. Provides
 * functionality to query the index to find items that are within a specified distance to a given search point. The
 * index is immutable once constructed.
 * <p>
 * The index handles points in a geographic rather than a planar context, and as a result correctly handles issues such
 * as wrapping at the 180Â° antimeridian without requiring queries to be split.
 * <p>
 * Note that as with many such libraries distance calculations are based on a sphere and not a spheroid. This leads to
 * small inaccuracies of up to 0.56% at extremes (near a pole or meridional near the equator). If this extra precision
 * is needed, it is suggested to add a small percentage buffer to the given distance and then filter using a more
 * precise spheroid distance calculation on the returned items.
 *
 * @param <T> the type of items contained within the index.
